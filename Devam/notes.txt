JVM---->
JVM is known as Java Virtual Machine. 
It is called a virtual machine because it doesn't physically exist.
It is a specification that provides a runtime environment in which Java bytecode can be executed. 
It can also run those programs which are written in other languages and compiled to Java bytecode.

The JVM performs the following main tasks:

Loads code
Verifies code
Executes code
Provides runtime environment


JRE-->
Java Runtime Environment
JVM is a part of JRE
It provides libraries for running our java code
eg. jar files



JDK-->
JDK stands for Java Development Kit.
The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development environment which is 
used to develop Java applications and applets.
It physically exists.
It contains JRE + development tools.




Types of Varibles in Java

3 types of Varibles
local Varible
instance Varible
static Varible


what is Varible??
A variable is the name of a reserved area allocated in memory.
In other words, it is a name of the memory location. 
It is a combination of "vary + able" which means its value can be changed.

int a = 50; --> Here a is a Varible where 50 is stored.

Java Control Statements: 


Java Operators:
1. Arithmetic Operators --> + - * / % ++ -- 
2. Relational Operators --> == >= <= != > < 



Java provides 3 types of control flow Statements.
1. Decision making Statements
    a. if Statements
    b. switch Statements

2. Loop Statements
    a.
    b.
    c.
    d.

3. Jump Statements
    a.
    b.



Switch Case??
Switch Statement in java is used to execute one statement from Multiple conditions.
It is similar to the if-else ladder 

Access Modifiers:
Public 
Private
Protected
Default

Difference between Default and public Access Modifiers 
OOPS:
Object oriented Programming System

Object
Class
Inheritance
Polymorpism
Encaplutation

Why do we require Inheritance????
I don't want repeat myself, I do want to reuse my code, I want my code to look simple, I want to code less
I want my code to be more efficient..


Types of Inheritance-
1. Single Level Inheritance
2. Multilevel Level Inheritance
3. Multiple Level Inheritance // not supported by java
4. Hirerichical Inheritance
5. Hybrid Inheritance
