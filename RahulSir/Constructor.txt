What is Constructor?
-----------------------

Constructors are special member functions whose task is to initialize the objects of its class. 
It is treated as a special member function because its name is the same as the class name. 
Java constructors are invoked when their objects are created. It is named such because, it 
constructs the value, i.e., provide data for the object, i.e., they are used to initialize 
objects. Every class has a constructor when we don't explicitly declare a constructor for 
any java class the compiler creates a default constructor for that class which does not have 
any return type. The constructor in Java cannot be abstract, static, final or synchronized 
and these modifiers are not allowed for the constructor.


Features of Constructor:-
---------------------------
1) An interface cannot have the constructor.
2) Constructors cannot be private.
3) A constructor cannot be abstract, static, final, native, strictfp, or synchronized
4) A constructor can be overloaded.
5) Constructors cannot return a value.
6) Constructors do not have a return type; not even void.
7) An abstract class can have the constructor.
8) Constructors name must be similar to that of the class name inside which it resides.
9) Constructors are automatically called when an object is created.
