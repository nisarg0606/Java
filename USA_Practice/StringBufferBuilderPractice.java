            Start: 
            Step 1: You can take a Static 2 strings or you can take strings from the user and 
                    create a empty C StringBuffer Directly
            Step 2: You need to pass those strings as an parameter to the StingBuilder
            Step 3: initialize a flag varible
            Step 4: Start the while loop
            Step 5: Try catch for IndexOutOfBound Exception
            Step 5: Compare the first Characters of both the strings(CharAt) using if else
            Step 6: in if else you need to append that character in C string and after appending 
            you need to delete that chacter
            Step 7: when one of the string becomes null(you will get index of of bound exception)
                     you need to end the while loop by making the flag varible change
            Step 8: Append the remaining string from A or B to the end of C String
            Step 9: Print the C String
            End:
