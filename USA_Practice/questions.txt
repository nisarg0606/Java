In today's session you need to perform this codes

1) Write a Java program to read a given string and if the first or last characters are same return the string without those characters otherwise return the 
string unchanged.
(Try using both String methods and StringBuffer/Builder)
	Sample Output:

	The given strings is: testcricket
	The new string is: estcricke

2) Write a Java program to read a string and return the string without the first two characters. Keep the first character if it is 'g' and keep the 
second character if it is 'h'.

Sample Output:

The given strings is: goat
The new string is: gat

he given strings is: photo
The new string is: hoto

The given strings is: ghost
The new string is: ghost

1) Write a program to Find all Pairs of elements in an array whose sum is equal to a specified number.
example input:  
		Array: {2, 7, 4, -5, 11, 5, 20}
		Specified Number: 15
	output:
		4 + 11 = 15
		-5 + 20 = 15
HINT: you need use nested for loop and check all compability.
Step 1,2, till length of array: 1st number and 2nd number , 1st number and 3rd number, 1st and 4th number and so on till last.
Next Step: 2nd and 3rd, 2nd and 4th, 2nd and 5th and so on till last number.
Till both loops are completed.

2) Write a program to check the following conditions in the password.
	1. A password must have at least eight characters.
	2. A password consists of only letters and digits.
	3. A password must contain at least two digits and at least two letters/characters.
	input1:	reyaansh
	output:	Please enter atleast 2 numbers.
	input2:	soham
	output:	Please enter a valid length.
	input 3: Nidish2004
	output:	Nidish2004 is a valid password.
	input 4: M200595493
	output:	Please enter atleast 2 characters.
	input 5: Milan_2006
	output:  Please enter numbers and characters only.

Hint: you need to use counters and also you need to get character by character to check that. Also, you need to create 
boolean functions like is_Letter and is_Number if not than return please enter numbers and characters only
